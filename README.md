# tasks

## calculator.py

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python. It provides a menu-based interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator runs in a loop, taking input from the user until they choose to exit. Each operation is implemented as a separate function, promoting code clarity and modularity. The program also includes basic input validation and handles division by zero errors gracefully.

## to_do_list.py

A simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks using a numbered menu interface. All tasks are stored in a tasks.txt file, so they are saved between sessions and persist even after the program is closed. The app uses basic Python features like lists, file handling with open(), and loops, making it easy to understand and modify for beginners learning Python.
