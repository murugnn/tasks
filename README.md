## calculator.py

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python. It provides a menu-based interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator runs in a loop, taking input from the user until they choose to exit. Each operation is implemented as a separate function, promoting code clarity and modularity. The program also includes basic input validation and handles division by zero errors gracefully.
